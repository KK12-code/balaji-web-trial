                    <h3>Dr M Nagi Reddy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Chairman and Managing Director</strong><br>MBBS.,MRCP., MRCGP., MSc., MBA.,LLb.</p>
                    <p>An Endocrinologist, Diabetologist, and General Physician, Dr. M Nagi Reddy graduated (MBBS) from the prestigious Gandhi Medical College, Bassherbagh, Hyderabad. He initially worked as a resident and senior resident in Gandhi General Hospital & various corporate hospitals in Hyderabad.

He also holds a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) specializing in Strategic Hospital Administration. Dr Nagi Reddy also has special interests in Medico Legal aspects of medicine and holds a Degree in Indian Law (LLB), from Osmania University. In his career spanning over two decades, he has been associated with several organizations in India, Europe, UK, and USA. Recognizing his robust contribution to activities of clinical profession development & teaching, he was bestowed with an award for “Outstanding Contribution in Profession” by the Royal College of Physicians, London.</p>
                    <p>Leading the team from the front, and representing your group of friends, classmates and colleagues has always been his passion and cup of tea. He has always been heavily involved in all types of leadership activities since his school days in Hyderabad Public School. It continued while he was in Gandhi Medical College. He has represented the college at various levels like Class Representative and Secretary to the Union. This saga of leadership has continued while he was in the UK. He has represented various groups of doctors including ethnic minority Indian doctors and also the Native British Junior and Senior doctors group. It has always been a rewarding experience with beautiful results.</p>
                    <p>Dr Reddy is a Medical Doctor and with his innate business skills is also a visionary Entrepreneur. Dr Nagi Reddy has been a successful entrepreneur creating wealth for the company and in the process achieving numerous other benefits to the society. Few hundred people are working in his organisations at various levels learning for themselves from the organisation and at the same time bringing their own experience and expertise to the table. He is currently Director in three corporate boards. He is the founder chairman and managing director of the health care arm Shree Balaji Multi Speciality Care Pvt Ltd. The company was established in 2016 and has been achieving newer heights in the field of medical care in the past few years. The core part of the health care arm is the tertiary care hospital, diagnostics, field trials and treatment. It is known by the brand Jubilee Hospitals.</p>
                    <p>Many of the patients cannot afford a consultation fee to the doctor along with prescription charges for the medicines or injections. As a doctor in India, my regular day to day work not only involved being a professional doctor but also more a Mentor, Social Worker and Advisor. Many of the daily medical consultations were Free. We aim to distribute medicines Free wherever we can. We have also been heavily involved in getting many chronic medical conditions treated and operations done Free of Cost in various hospitals. My main aim in the near future is to establish an Institute for Diabetes, which caters to the need of the poor. As diagnosing someone who cannot afford or look after his diabetes is no good. Part of the future plan is to set up a free of cost voluntary Institute of Diabetes, which would work FREE for the poor and needy. He is keen to dedicate the rest of his life for the service of the poor and the downtrodden.</p>
                    <p>I am also the founder member of N R Foundation. We as an association are actively involved in voluntary activities at village level in rural areas. We have provided infrastructure facilities to 3 schools in villages, like tables, chairs, benches and black boards. We have collected and donated for various charity activities. There are long term plans to adopt a few villages in the back ward districts and develop them holistically.</p>
                    <p>Dr Nagi Reddys main reason for the entry into political turf, is the belief that a lot can be achieved effective leadership together with voluntary work. Being part of the federal administration is essential for the implementation of various programmes. It gives completeness to any project and things can be easily achieved. Being in the political field also gives us more clear opportunities to find out about the difficulties and be more involved with the core of the problems. Association with a political party also gives us a group of like-minded people who can be involved in the making of policy decisions that change the destiny of the country.</p>

As part of the teaching and training he has pains takingly set up the training programme under the Prime Minister Skill Development Programmes. The training programmes and centres established by Dr Nagi Reddy have trained numerous young men and women. The training has ensured that the trainees earn a respectful and good living.

                    <p>Reading is another passion for Dr Nagi Reddy since his childhood.
