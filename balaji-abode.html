                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Project Overview</h3>
                <p>The land for the Balaji Abode project was acquired in January of 2016. The plot was brought and registered at the SRO, Kallur, Kurnool, AP. The land was part of two houses allotted by APHB in the well planned lay out of AP Housing Board Colony. After through verification of the paperwork Balaji Techbuild brought the land and is held as a free hold with the company. As it is a free hold land completely owned by Balaji Techbuild the required plans for the construction of the apartment building have been obtained from Kurnool Municipality. Other essential permissions including ground water permission for Bore, Electricity, Municipal Water Connection were obtained from the relevant departments. Construction work at the site commenced in the month of March 2023. All the construction work is planned properly and being implemented meticulously. The aim is to complete the work and deliver the habitable flat by December 2023. Providing the best of amenities for our life time customers is always a top priority. We are giving at most importance to the best quality amenities which are built properly, good quality and strength, eco friendly and easily maintained in the long run. The project, out of the 4 sides is 2 Sides Open to road and will allow for Ample Sunlight & Cross Ventilation. The other two sides are the neighbours property but care has been taken and according to the municipal guidelines and site plan enough space is left to make all the apartments well ventilated.</p>
